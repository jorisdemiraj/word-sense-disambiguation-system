    DO NOT MODIFY THE SIGNATURE!
    This is the skeleton of the prediction function.
    The predict function will build your model, load the weights from the checkpoint and write a new file (output_path)
    with your predictions in the "<id> <BABELSynset>" format (e.g. "d000.s000.t000 bn:01234567n").
    
    The resources folder should contain everything you need to make the predictions. It is the "resources" folder in your submission.
    
    N.B. DO NOT HARD CODE PATHS IN HERE. Use resource_path instead, otherwise we will not be able to run the code.
    If you don't know what HARD CODING means see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding

    :param input_path: the path of the input file to predict in the same format as Raganato's framework (XML files you downloaded).
    :param output_path: the path of the output file (where you save your predictions)
    :param resources_path: the path of the resources folder containing your model and stuff you might need.
    :param lang: the language of the dataset specified in input_path
